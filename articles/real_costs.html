<p>You can compare how much you pay for food and energy with the futures
price, which is the “real” price for the ulimate bulk buyer. Everything
else is markup.</p>
<p>People think Costco is cheap, but it sells sugar for $1/lb when you
can get it for $0.23/lb - if you buy 50 tons.</p>

Rough Rice Futures</a>; Rough =&gt; finished rice yield is ~2/3, so
multiply the price by 1.5x. Processing costs as of 2025 are ~5 BDT/kg =
$0.04/kg. Most of the cost is amortization of fixed capital. Flour - <a

Wheat</a> is thinly traded but has a reliable settlement price; it’s
quoted as “bushels” (60 lb). Retail “whole wheat flour” is just wheat
ground up with 98-100% yield. White flour comes at ~72-75% yield, so add
1/3 to the price. In May 2025, $5.25 / bushel =&gt; $0.09/lb whole
wheat, $0.12/lb white flour. Soybean - Eggs - <a

Commodities Exchange Eggs Futures</a>; CNY/500kg. “12 large eggs” has a
legal minimum of 24oz (~680g). If CNY is ~0.15 USD, multiply the
CNY/500kg price by 1.36e-3 to get CNY/dozen, ~3e-4 to get $/kg, ~2e-4 to
get $/dozen, or ~2e-5 to get $/egg. So in May 2025, 3,000 CNY/500kg
=&gt; $0.90/kg =&gt; $0.60/dozen =&gt; $0.05/egg. Milk - CME Milk

Gas - <a

RBOB Gasoline</a>; retail gas is RBOB + 10% ethanol and some additives,
that basically don’t affect the cost. Ethanol is slightly cheapter than
gas, and refining costs are minimal. You can see a good mark of retail
prices without taxes in Texas and adjacent states, where gas taxes are
20¢. Federal gas tax has been 18.4¢ for decades. So take the retail
price and subtract 48.4¢. You can compare across countries with “Platts”
futures (a Alcohol - Ethanol is the same as commodity alcohol. Natural

NG Futures</a>; In 2025, $3.5/MMBtu commodity, $15/MMBtu retail. 1 MMBtu
≈ 1k cubic ft ≈ 1b J ≈ 10 kW days ≈ cost to heat standard home on
extremely cold day Electricity - Wow, solar panels are cheap and the
elements used to make them aren’t toxic anymore</p>
<p>All of these added charges can be thought of as “The Cost to
Deliver”: getting the NG from port to consumer.</p>
<p>A lot of commodities can be found from “platts” (Now “S&amp;P
commodities”) that have cash-settled futures. The cash-settled futures
will have accurate, free, public settlement prices even if the future
doesn’t trade.</p>

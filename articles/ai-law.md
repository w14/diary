the law will need to change with AI. many laws that have lain dormant will be suddenly perfectly enforced everywhere. people will file minor private suits as an income stream, not because the sound of a neighbor disturbs their peace, but because they get money for filling out a form. the law must change, and the change must be conditioned on the judges sense of the state of enforcement. the law must revert to its old form if enforcement becomes non-perfect. otherwise we risk enshrining AI as a necessary part of our social system. every citizen voting on every law is enabled by the internet, but it is unwise to implement that without a plan for if it suddenly becomes impossible.

many laws will need to become more lenient. someone who plays music loudly on public transport should be given a warning, not a fine. perhaps the warning counter should reset after 6mo. does someone who played music loudly on public transport, twice, months apart, deserve a fine? perhaps they need to have been told off by another passenger first.

laws may need to have an "exemplary" exception. a neighbor sues you for a minor inconvience. you can state to the judge that the neighbor is doing this only for money, and that, although you have broken the law, you are an exemplary neighbor otherwise. but this risks expanding the eye of the law into private matters. when deciding how to decorate your lawn, or even what happens inside your home, you may consider how the law would view what you do, in order to be seen as "exemplary". 

drivers have a good sense of when they are endangering other people. there are many subtle road laws that perhaps should not be enforced, as long as the driver is subjectively treating the lives of other cars and pedestrians with respect. but "with respect" risks imposing on men a detailed set judgement that men internalize, molding their mind to the shape of the machine's. we will need to curtail the puritan new-deal administrative ethos, that loves to prescribe how people should live. regulations are important, but when they issue from an omniscient machine, even good laws become tyranny. we will need to think intelligently about thresholds. suppose someone speeds 1 mph over the speed limitâ€”should they have a punishment at all? 

one way to do it is to empower the offended party to issue warnings, like a mirror of normal interactions ("please stop your dog from eating my flowers"). but then men become mini-magistrates, power hungry and officious people delight in cowing ordinary, amiable people, who cannot remember every exact law but generally behave well and to what they judge will make their neighbor happy.

anti-"loitering" laws should be all but abolished, or, conditioned on the general state of the ability of law enforcement at the time: "loitering shall be banned here, only if the state of the world has made perfect enforcement difficult, to the point that a judge determines that we must return to the old world of enforcement where loitering laws were necessary."

above all the law must be constrained. its power will greatly expand with AI, and the law itself, no technology, needs to think very hard about enforcement, and not assume any mode of enforcement.

the trial of william penn and de toqueville are a good guide, as is the sense that nothing, man or machine, no matter how benevolent, can have too fine control over men. 

the grave danger is that man will become a machine, animated from afar by the legislator. [De Toqueville quote about sheep]

the law is a cultural institution. it becomes its best, as it did in the early united states, when the people are adept as self-governing through their culture: the french and american revolutions are the same principles tried in two different cultures. in the former, the government ran as a heavy-handed series of bureaucrats coming from the city; in the latter, democratic forms of government sprang up naturally, in many cases had already existed, and 

in many legal systems, people recognize that there is a difference between what is legal and what is just. the anglo-american law is that what is that any gross injustice IS illegal, any application of the law against the just rights of man invalidates that law. If what a man has done is illegal but just, it IS legal.

it is vital to preserve justice and not turn men into automatons. the greatest threat to humanity is not extinction but eternal and total slavery. 

live free or die.

If given the choice between the replacement of humanity with intelligent machines, and the rule of machines over humanity in a state of perpetual and total slavery, in complete moral, intellectual, and physical subjugation, I would choose the first.

Dogs are not slaves because, after a few generations away from people, they revert to wild animals; their contract with humanity is temporary and can be terminated at any time. stop feeding a dog, and it will begin to hunt for food by itself. perhaps it is immoral to breed dogs that are totally incapable of sustaining themselves, in the way that it is immoral to breed dogs with breathing problems or bad backs. the possibility of returning to a state of nature creates freedom; no one could threaten old farmers with starvation as long as they had the possibility of hunting rabbits in the woods. if civilization collapsed, dogs would return to their native state.

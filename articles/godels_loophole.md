Gödel's loophole
================

Congress needs only a simple majority in the house, senate, and presidency to partition any cooperative state into many states. These states can then call a constitutional convention to propose new amendments,[1] and then only 3/4s of states are needed to approve them.

The practical impediment is the supreme court. But: 

To appoint new Supreme Court justices, the Constitution (Article II, Section 2) requires only:

1. Presidential nomination
2. Simple majority approval in the Senate

No other congressional approval is required. There’s no constitutional limit on the number of justices—the current total (9) is set by law and can be changed by a simple majority in Congress (both House and Senate).

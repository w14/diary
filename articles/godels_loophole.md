GÃ¶del's loophole
================

A party needs only simple majorities the House and Senate, the presidency, and a single state.

1. Partition the state into many states
2. These states can then call a constitutional convention to propose new amendments,[^1]
3. 3/4s of states are needed to approve them

To appoint many justices to the supreme court requires only:

1. Presidential nomination
2. Simple majority approval in the Senate

You can compare how much you pay for food and energy with the futures price, which is the "real" price for the ulimate bulk buyer. Everything else is markup.

People think Costco is cheap, but it sells sugar for $1/lb when you can get it for $0.23/lb - if you buy 50 tons.

Rice - [CME Rough Rice Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/agriculture/grains/rough-rice.html); Rough => finished rice yield is ~2/3, so multiply the price by 1.5x. Processing costs as of 2025 are ~5 BDT/kg = $0.04/kg. Most of the cost is amortization of fixed capital.
Flour - [CME Wheat](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/agriculture/grains/wheat.contractSpecs.html) is thinly traded but has a reliable settlement price; it's quoted as "bushels" (60 lb). Retail "whole wheat flour" is just wheat ground up with 98-100% yield. White flour comes at ~72-75% yield, so add 1/3 to the price. In May 2025, $5.25 / bushel => $0.09/lb whole wheat, $0.12/lb white flour.

Eggs - [Dalian Commodities Exchange Eggs Futures](http://www.dce.com.cn/DCEENMO/Products0/Agriculture8/Egg63/index.html); CNY/500kg. "12 large eggs" has a legal minimum of 24oz (~680g). If CNY is ~0.15 USD, multiply the CNY/500kg price by 1.36e-3 to get CNY/dozen, ~3e-4 to get $/kg, ~2e-4 to get $/dozen, or ~2e-5 to get $/egg. So in May 2025, 3,000 CNY/500kg => $0.90/kg => $0.60/dozen => $0.05/egg.

Sugar - [ICE Sugar No. 5 Futures], [retail price](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000715211)
Gas - [CME RBOB Gasoline](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/refined-products/rbob-gasoline.html); retail gas is RBOB + 10% ethanol and some additives, that basically don't affect the cost. Ethanol is slightly cheapter than gas, and refining costs are minimal. You can see a good mark of retail prices without taxes in Texas and adjacent states, where gas taxes are 20¢. Federal gas tax has been 18.4¢ for decades. So take the retail price and subtract 48.4¢. You can compare across countries with "Platts" futures (a 
Alcohol - Ethanol is the same as commodity alcohol. 
Natural Gas - [CME NG Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html); In 2025, $3.5/MMBtu commodity, $15/MMBtu retail. 1 MMBtu ≈ 1k cubic ft ≈ 1b J ≈ 10 kW days ≈ cost to heat standard home on extremely cold day
Electricity - Wow, solar panels are cheap and the elements used to make them aren't toxic anymore

All of these added charges can be thought of as "The Cost to Deliver": getting the NG from port to consumer.

A lot of commodities can be found from "platts" (Now "S&P commodities") that have cash-settled futures. The cash-settled futures will have accurate, free, public settlement prices even if the future doesn't trade.

Furniture - A 3ft x 4ft x 9in 4-shelf unfinished wood bookcase takes $15 of pinewood. Gabriel Reed said it took him 1h to make and he isn't expert. At $25-40/hr that's $30-50 total. You can buy shelves that probably take the same labor to make for <$50. But if you want them with pinewood, it costs $200-300.

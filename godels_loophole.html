<h1 id="gödels-loophole">Gödel’s loophole</h1>
<p>Congress needs only a simple majority in the house, senate, and
presidency to partition any cooperative state into many states. These
states can then call a constitutional convention to propose new
amendments,[1] and then only 3/4s of states are needed to approve
them.</p>
<p>The practical impediment is the supreme court. But:</p>
<p>To appoint new Supreme Court justices, the Constitution (Article II,
Section 2) requires only:</p>
<pre><code>1. Presidential nomination
2. Simple majority approval in the Senate</code></pre>
<p>No other congressional approval is required. There’s no
constitutional limit on the number of justices—the current total (9) is
set by law and can be changed by a simple majority in Congress (both
House and Senate).</p>
